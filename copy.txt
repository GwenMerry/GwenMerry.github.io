Studley Community
Choir gathers every Wednesday evening at Studley Methodist Church, from 6:30 to 8:30, providing an open
invitation to anyone with a love for singing. Join us, whether by simply showing up or reaching out through
our social media channels, and become part of a harmonious community where the joy of music brings people
together.
