          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p> Studley Community Choir is a vibrant musical ensemble founded by Nat, a music enthusiast dedicated to
            fostering a love for singing and the numerous health benefits it brings. Our choir is driven by the vision
            of
            creating an inclusive and affordable space where people from all walks of life can come together, connect,
            and
            unite through the power of song. Nat's passion for making music accessible to as many individuals as
            possible
            led to the establishment of this welcoming community. Guided by the expertise of our musical director,
            Abbie,
            and the musical curation of Gwen, we offer a diverse repertoire spanning various genres.

        <div class="col">
          <h2>Why Sing?</h2>
          <p>Singing is good for the soul, and we 100% agree with this! Singing regularly is proven to reduce stress and
            help with confidence building. Not only does singing work those throat muscles but singing with a choir is a
            great way of making new friends. Our aim is to be completely inclusive and welcoming, it doesn't matter if
            you've
            never tried singing before or if you are used to performing. We aim to be a warm environment where you can
            have
            a go and boost your self esteem whilst having good fun.
            There is no need to be able to read music, but if you can, great! We work together to achieve a wonderful
            sound
            which we are proud to share with people! Give us a try! </p>

          <h3>Nat</h3>
          <p>The passionate owner of the choir, founded the ensemble driven by her deep love for music and the joy
            of
            singing in a communal setting. Recognizing the numerous health benefits associated with group singing, she
            envisioned a choir that would be inclusive and accessible to a diverse range of individuals. Nat aimed to
            create a safe and affordable space where people could connect through song and a shared purpose. Fueled by a
            desire to remove barriers and offer a repertoire spanning various musical genres, Nat encountered challenges
            in
            finding local choirs that embraced these values. Undeterred, she took matters into her own hands and
            successfully launched the Studley Community Choir.. <br>
